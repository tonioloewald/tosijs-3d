# Changelog

All notable changes to **tosijs-3d**. This project is pre-1.0 (`0.x`), so minor
versions may carry breaking peer-dependency changes — each is called out in a
**⚠️ Breaking** block in its version section below, with what a consumer must do.

## 0.5.0

### ⚠️ Breaking — peer dependencies

- **Babylon.js 8 → 9.** Peer range for `@babylonjs/core`, `@babylonjs/gui`,
  `@babylonjs/loaders`, `@babylonjs/materials` moved `^8` → `^9`. **Consumers must
  upgrade their Babylon to `9.x`.** A project still on Babylon 8 will hit an
  `ERESOLVE` on install.
- **Jolt physics `^1.0` → `^1.1`** (Jolt 5.6.0 — the friction model moved). Only
  relevant if you use `<tosi-b3d-physics>`; retune friction if grip/slide changed.
- **Packaging fix:** `@babylonjs/*` and `jolt-physics` are now **peer-only** (they
  were previously declared in both `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`). A hard
  Babylon dependency would nest a *second* engine copy in a consumer holding a
  direct Babylon dep — silently breaking `instanceof`, engine singletons, and
  plugin registration. No action needed by consumers; this just makes install
  resolution correct.

### Added

- **Clouds** (`<tosi-b3d-clouds>`) — an opaque blob cloud layer you can *fly into*
  and lose the world inside (a fog whiteout, not a texture). A `coverage` weather
  dial from wisps to thunderheads, and `insideCloud` so a cloud is a *tactic*
  (break a radar lock, shake a pursuer).
- **Projected cloud shadows** (`cloud-shadows.ts`) — the field painted top-down
  into one texture, sampled by world position in a material plugin, so shadows
  conform to terrain and fall on elevated receivers (the aircraft) too. Reusable.
- **Shadow decals** (`shadow-decal.ts`) — a reusable soft blob-shadow for a single
  caster (character, vehicle, dropped item).
- **Death** (`<tosi-b3d-death>`) — death's exit: explode + burning wreckage,
  release input, a third-person spectate shot, then a respawn panel. Flat and VR.
- **Encounters** — `<tosi-b3d-spawner>` (seeded, "same seed, same battles"),
  `formations.ts` (pure placement math), and a named `prefab` registry with
  `spawnPrefab` for the set-dressing a death or spawn drops.
- **Ambient effects** (`<tosi-b3d-ambient>`) — device-budgeted garnish (motes,
  bubbles, tumbling leaves) that competes for one pool and switches **off** rather
  than thinning into a lie. Pure budget allocator in `ambient-budget.ts`.
- **Atmosphere** (`atmosphere.ts`) — pure fog compositing so underwater / cloud /
  space whiteouts layer over the base fog instead of fighting it.
- **`setGameplayCamera`** — an XR-safe viewpoint affordance (move the rig in a
  headset, swap the camera when flat), so chase/death/vehicle transitions stop
  breaking in VR.
- **`PLATFORM.md`** — the platform bet (stay on the web, don't abstract the
  renderer; the real risk of the Android XR / Vision Pro shift is *input*).

### Changed

- **Aircraft** — the stick is dead on the ground (only the throttle lifts off);
  you can't crash-land until you've actually cleared the pad; chase camera banks
  smoothly and no longer jitters on throttle.
- **Water** follows the camera as an endless sea; **terrain** auto-centers so a sea
  at `y=0` floods the valleys.
- **HUD** survives respawn.
- Babylon `8.56 → 9.16`, Jolt `1.0 → 1.1`, tosijs-ui `1.6.22 → 1.6.23`, tosijs
  `1.6.8 → 1.6.9` (dev-server/haltija reliability), haltija `→ 1.4.0`.

### Fixed

- Death explosion/wreck FX land at the real wreck; a respawn is no longer charred
  (char a cloned material, not the shared library one).
- The aircraft ground-ray no longer picks a cloud blob as "ground" (mid-air
  "crash"); cloud whiteout is opaque under LINEAR fog and builds from every
  direction; the live-debug timer is cleared on scene disconnect (no leak).
