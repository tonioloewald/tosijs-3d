# Material Conventions

These conventions apply to all meshes entering the scene — via
[b3d-loader](?b3d-loader.ts), [b3d-library](?b3d-library.ts), or any
component that calls `register()`.

## Property-Based (automatic from Blender materials)

| Property | Threshold | Effect |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| `alpha` > 0.95 | snapped to 1.0 | Treated as fully opaque (avoids blend cost) |
| `alpha` ≤ 0.95 | — | Alpha blend, depth pre-pass, double-sided, excluded from shadow casting |
| `unlit` (glTF KHR_materials_unlit) | — | Respected as-is |
| Transmission > 0 + `_mirror` | — | Cubemap-based refraction with proper IOR (replaces glTF screen-space) |

## Name Suffixes (behavioral overrides, not material appearance)

| Suffix | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `_noshadow` / `-noshadow` | Mesh doesn't receive shadows |
| `_nocast` / `-nocast` | Mesh doesn't cast shadows |
| `_mirror` / `-mirror` | Dynamic reflection probe (+ refraction if transmissive) |
| `-ignore` | Node is disposed on load |
| `_collide*` | Physics collider (sphere/box/cylinder/mesh) |
