# world-contract

The boundary between the **simulation** (tosijs-3d) and an **external driver**
(an AI narrative engine, a scripted demo, anything). The simulation is the
authority on physical and systemic reality; the driver decides what any of it
*means*. These two halves never call each other's functions — they share a
serializable `WorldState`, a stream of best-effort `SimulationEvent`s, and the
`WorldApi` surface below.

## Hard rules baked into these types

- **The simulation is narrative-blind.** There is no `plot`, `quest`,
  `objective`, or `mission` vocabulary here, by design. The simulation reports
  *what physically happened*; it never judges what it completed.
- **The driver is never load-bearing.** A simulation built on this contract
  runs as a complete sandbox with no driver attached. Intents are *advisory*.
- **Events are commitments, not considerations.** The stream carries
  intentional acts (interacted, picked up, chose, died) — never proximity or
  "the player walked near X". Walking past a witness is no story beat; talking
  to them is. Withholding proximity forces the driver to read engagement, not
  loitering.
- **Events are best-effort.** Delivery is not guaranteed; the stream may drop
  under load. A *dropped* event is silent (no harm). A *delivered* event the
  driver can't place is the only signal worth worrying about.
- **Query is truth; events are hints.** `subscribe` is a cheap, lossy push
  ("maybe look"). Before a consequential decision, the driver `getState`/
  `getEntity` to verify ("actually check"). That makes lossy events safe.
- **Stable identity round-trips.** The `EntityId` the driver gets from `spawn`
  is the exact id that comes back in events — so the driver recognizes its own
  fingerprints. An optional opaque `ref` rides along untouched by the sim.
- **Time crosses the boundary; the sim owns the clock.** `WorldState.now` is
  the one continuous quantity the driver needs — all inference-from-absence
  ("it's been a while and nothing happened") is built on it.

## The driver belongs OFF-THREAD — and this contract is already the membrane

A GM/narrative driver *thinks*: a planner, a search, an LLM round-trip. That's
100ms–2s, which inline is 20–200 dropped frames. It must never run on the frame
thread. (See `PERF-DESIGN.md` — this is the one acceleration case we've
**approved**; terrain's worker was measured and rejected.)

The seam is **latency tolerance, not CPU cost**, and it is exactly the seam these
rules already draw. Every hard rule above, written for *decoupling*, turns out to
be precisely what makes a worker **correct**:

- **Advisory intents ⇒ async is SAFE.** An intent that arrives late — or never —
  leaves the simulation complete and consistent. You cannot put a *load-bearing*
  component behind a membrane without inventing a stall; this one is load-bearing
  nowhere.
- **Best-effort events ⇒ shed, don't queue.** Under backpressure, DROP or coalesce.
  A driver that falls behind must never accumulate a queue that later delivers
  stale advice — that converts a slow GM into a wrong one.
- **Query is truth ⇒ the async gap is survivable.** An intent is computed against a
  snapshot the world has already moved past. The rule "re-`getState` before a
  consequential decision" exists for lossy events, and it is the same rule that
  makes a *round-trip delay* safe. The sim validates intents anyway.
- **Serializable `WorldState` + stable round-tripping `EntityId`s ⇒ small parcels,
  surviving references.** Events out, intents in: tens of bytes to a few KB. Nothing
  needs a shared heap.
- **Deterministic, `Date.now`-free store ⇒ replay and audit.** The same seed and the
  same event log reproduce the session — which is what an agentic GM needs to be
  debuggable at all.

Two shape notes, because they decide the plumbing:

- **The driver is an ACTOR, not a task.** Long-lived, persistent memory across ticks,
  it *initiates* (an intent nobody asked for), and it does network I/O. That is not
  a request/response worker pool.
- **Run it on a VM, not wasm.** GM code is agent-authored, so it wants injected
  capabilities and a gas limit (the gas limit *is* its worst-case guarantee), and it
  sidesteps `unsafe-eval`. Wasm is for numeric kernels; a decision-maker is not one.
